        <p class="post">By day, I travel the land as a level one Researcher in the relam of Finances.  
            I seek to understand the life of laborers, and work with my clan to design enchanted tools of the trades.
            By night, I train in the magics of software development. This place is the substance that I have conjured thus far.
            I long to create a safe haven for my kin to gather outside of space to flourish.

        <p class="post">In a land where nothing is simple and fair is a myth, there is a man who never tires. As the legend goes, 
          this man was born from a bloodline that carries unlimited strength and remarkable appearance. He is known to disguise himself as 
          a commander of a group of humans performing services to those in need of repair to their carriages. It is told that should he be 
          discovered as a god it would destory the sprits of humanity, and those who have wronged him would painfully perish. As the prophecy 
          goes, there will but one woman that can harness his power. There is limited knowledge of this womans identity, but she is said to
          be a powerful sorceress who can conjure relams from nothing.

      <h2 class="title"> Cure Loneliness with Alchmey
      </h2>

      <p class="post">After almost 404 failed attempts I have finally done it! I have created 
        a spell so powerful it will one day cure loneliness accross the relam! Using the powers 
        SQLAlchemy I have created a way to teleport messages and information to a safe place that 
        can be later used to connect my people. The excitement is shortlived however, now that I have 
        harnessed this power I need to ensure this powers is used for good. There are other sorcerers 
        that use this power as dark magic and even a means of mind control. I have to be careful not 
        let this happen in my relam.
